#Objective

The purpose of this project is to help the campus facilities team identify energy-saving opportunities by analyzing electricity consumption data from multiple buildings. The project aims to:

Combine meter data from multiple buildings. Clean and validate raw datasets. Perform daily and weekly energy analysis. Generate visual dashboards for decision-making. Produce a summary report highlighting patterns and anomalies. #Dataset Source The electricity usage data was stored as multiple .csv files inside a /data/ directory. Each file represented one building’s hourly meter readings, containing:

| Column | Description | | timestamp | Date and hour of energy measurement | | kwh | Electricity consumed during that hour | | building | Building name (added automatically if missing) |

#Methodology

#1. Data Ingestion

Used os.listdir() to detect all CSV files inside the data/ folder. Loaded each file using pandas.read_csv(). Added missing metadata (building name). Handled corrupt/missing files using try–except. #2. Data Cleaning

Converted timestamps to datetime format. Sorted all data chronologically. Combined all building files into a single clean dataset. Exported final dataset as cleaned_energy_data.csv. #3. Aggregation & Analysis

Performed multiple levels of statistical analysis:

Daily totals: resample("D").sum() Weekly totals: resample("W").sum() Building-wise summary: mean, min, max, and total energy usage These results were also exported to building_summary.csv.

Object-Oriented Approach Implemented three classes:
Building → stores readings, calculates totals MeterReading → represents a single reading BuildingManager → manages all buildings and their data This design makes the project scalable and readable.

###5. Executive Summary

Generated a summary.txt file containing:

Total campus consumption Highest-consuming building Peak load time Overall trends and observations #Key Insights

⭐ Total Energy Consumption The combined dataset shows significant variation in kWh usage across buildings. ⭐ Highest Consuming Building One building consistently records higher kWh values, indicating:

Higher occupancy More equipment usage Possible inefficiencies ⭐ Peak Load Times Peak loads typically occur:

Between 10 AM – 4 PM During working/lecture hours ⭐ Daily & Weekly Trends Weekly charts reveal a stable pattern after aggregating daily noise. Daily lines show fluctuations but follow a predictable daytime rise. ⭐ Opportunities for Energy Saving Buildings with unusually high consumption should undergo:

Equipment checks HVAC optimization Occupancy-based scheduling #Generated Output Files

File Description cleaned_energy_data.csv Combined and cleaned dataset building_summary.csv Stats per building summary.txt Executive summary report #Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can help campuses identify energy-saving opportunities. The pipeline—from ingestion to dashboard creation—provides an automated, scalable way to understand energy usage patterns and support smarter decision-making.
